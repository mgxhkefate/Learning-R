### What's *Learning R* ?

Thanks for AI coding, now we can easily learn how to use R to do more complex analysis. To record my career of learing R and organized the files processed, I established the project depending on the Rstudio.

In this repository, the **src folder** stores all the R scripts used in the Learning R project. The **Learning R.Rproj** is responsibe for managing the R package and data of this project and the **all.Rmd** documents all the note of R scripts. It's recommand for you to follow the all.Rmd and scripts to learn R.

### Preparation

First, the R and Rstuido should be installed on your pc. If you want to use the python scripts in the src folder to generate fake data to practice, you should also install the newest version of python.

Then, download all the files of this repository and put it in a file path which only contain letters and numbers. Run the **Learning R.Rproj** to let Rstudio auto-set the workspace path, and then click the **all.Rmd** file to start your journey of learning R !
