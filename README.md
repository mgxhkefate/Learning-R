### What's *Learning R* ?

This project is paired with another project named [**mgxh-publish-md**](https://github.com/mgxhkefate/mgxh-publish-md), a project of sharing class and learning notes in Chinese. If you want to know more about that project, you can click this [site](https://mgxhkefate.github.io/mgxh-publish-md/) !

For some reason, I have to write the files with Chinese (maybe English in the future)

### How to use ?

What you should do is just opening the **all.Rmd** and finding the **R scripts** (in the **./project/xxx/src**) mentioned in the all.Rmd. If it's your first time to use R and Rstudio, you had better install them and make sure you have install the R packages required and the up-to-data version of Rtool as some packages need it to build.

In this project, there are also some python scripts used to generate fake data for practice. So if you want to use these py scripts, you had better install the newest version of python.
